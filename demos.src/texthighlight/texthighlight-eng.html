<section><h3 id="thn">Travel Health Notice </h3>
<p>Travellers are reminded that countries around the world continue to report cases of avian influenza (H5N1), or &quot;bird flu&quot;.</p>
<p>While avian influenza (H5N1) commonly causes sickness in birds, it can also infect people. People who contract avian influenza can get very ill, and more than half die from it.</p>
<p>If you are travelling to a region <a href="#where">where avian influenza (H5N1) is known to be present</a>, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) recommends that you: </p>
<ol>
<li>Avoid all high-risk such as poultry farms and live animal markets.</li>
<li>Avoid eating undercooked eggs or poultry.</li>
<li>Wash your hands frequently.</li>
<li>See a health care provider if you develop flu-like symptoms while travelling or after you return to Canada</li>
</ol>

<section><h3 id="about">About Avian Influenza (H5N1)</h3>
<p>Avian influenza (H5N1), commonly known as &quot;bird flu&quot;, is a viral infection that can spread easily and quickly among birds.</p>
<p>A particularly strong subtype called the Highly Pathogenic (H5N1) has been found in birds in parts of Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Humans have become infected with this virus.</p>
	<section><h4>Symptoms</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Can take two to eight days and possibly longer to appear.</li>
	<li>Usually include symptoms similar to human influenza such as fever, cough, aching muscles and sore throat.</li>
	<li>In more severe cases people may develop serious respiratory conditions such as pneumonia which may lead to death. Fatality rates among hospitalized patients with confirmed infection is high (about 60%).</li>
	</ul>
	</section>
	<section><h4>Transmission</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Most human cases have been traced to direct contact with live infected birds or their droppings.</li>
	</ul>
	</section>
</section>

<section><h3 id="where">Where is Avian Influenza (H5N1) a Concern?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa have all had outbreaks of avian influenza (H5N1) in poultry since 2003.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li>Since 2009, cases of humans having caught H5N1 have been reported from Cambodia, China, Egypt, Indonesia and Vietnam. </li>
<li>From 2003 to early 2010, there have been nearly 500 confirmed human cases in 15 countries.</li>
<li>Worldwide, almost 300 people have died from avian influenza (H5N1). </li>
</ul>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) posts information on the <a href="#">total number of human cases of avian influenza</a> and <a href="#">maps of where human cases of avian influenza have occurred</a>. </p>
