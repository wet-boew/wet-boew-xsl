<h2 id="grids">Grids</h2>
<div class="span-4">
  <p>Grids have been around for a long time in print publishing, and have now moved to the Web. A grid is an invisible <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> wireframe used to achieve visual cohesion. It's like a lattice that divides space into sections used to hold content such as headings, text, lists, images and so on.</p>
  <h3 class="margin-bottom-none">Correct use</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Grids should be used for all layouts except when representing tabular data in a table format.</li>
    <li> Use when modifications to the default design increase the value to the user and/or content experience.</li>
    <li> Avoid using this CSS for strictly cosmetic or decorative purposes.</li>
  </ul>

<div class="span-4">
  <p>Desktop content can be hidden from the mobile user with the <code>mobile-hide</code> CSS and additional information can be presented to the mobile user with the <code>mobile-show</code> CSS. </p>
  <h3 class="margin-bottom-none">Correct use</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Since there is no <strong>Full site</strong> feature available to the mobile user, only decorative content or other supporting information should be hidden from them.  Actual content should be available to both the desktop and mobile users so there is no loss of information.</li>

<h2 id="form-layout"> Form layout</h2>
<p>In 2006, Matteo Penzo conducted a study to determine which layout  (of three common form layouts) was the most successful. The study  incorporated timing users on their form completion time, eye-tracking  software, and heat maps. Yahoo Web manager, Luke Wroblewski, further  discusses this in his book, <em><a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/webforms/">Web Form Design: Filling in the Blanks</a></em>. </p>
<p>Refer to the highlights from his book below: </p>
<h3>Option 1: Recommended</h3>
<div class="span-4">
  <p>Place the label above the input field. </p>
  <p>This is the <strong>recommended</strong> layout. This layout allows users to  capture both labels and input fields with a single eye movement. While  this is the simplest of layouts, users can actually process the  information ten times faster than if the information is left-aligned,  as demonstrated in option 3. However, this solution uses more vertical  space. This does not impact the user experience, but may not suit your  specific layout needs. Although this layout is the recommended option,  you can also use the layout provided in option 2, to reduce vertical  space. </p>
</div>
<div class="border-left">
  <div class="span-2 margin-bottom-none">
    <h4 class="margin-top-none margin-bottom-none color-medium">Demo</h4>
    <form>
      <label for="label-1-1">Label 1</label>
      <input type="text" size="10" id="label-1-1" name="label-1-1"/>
      <label for="label-2-1">Label 2</label>
      <input type="password" size="10" id="label-2-1" name="label-2-1"/>
      <input type="submit" value="Sign in" class="button button-accent"/>
    </form>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h3>Option 2: Alternate</h3>
<div class="span-4">
  <p>Place the label <strong>right</strong>-aligned to the input field. </p>
  <p>This is the alternate layout option. Use it when there is a need to  reduce vertical space by placing the form objects side-by-side. There  are not many situations when you need this option, as studies have  shown that users don't mind scrolling. Therefore, use this option 2  layout sparingly.<br />
    The reason this solution is preferred over left  aligned labels (option 3), is that eye tracking studies have shown that  it creates a clear association between label and field, which reduces  the number of fixations the user has (the eye jumping from spot to  spot) by nearly half. As a result, the reduced eye moments and clear  association reduces eye strain and improves cognition. This translates  to a 50% faster form completion rate. <br />

<h3>Option 3: Never use </h3>
<div class="span-4">
  <p>Place the label left-aligned to the input field. </p>
  <p>For the reasons mentioned in options 1 and 2, never use this layout. </p>

<h2 id="scrolling"> Page length and scrolling </h2>
<p>Renowned usability expert, Jakob Nielsen, has numerous studies about how users behave. </p>
<p>The article <a  href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/scrolling-attention.html">Scrolling and Attention</a> (external link) states: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Web users spend 80% of their time looking at  information above the page fold. Although users do scroll, they  allocate only 20% of their attention below the fold. </p>
  <p>During the Web's first years, users often didn't scroll Web pages at  all...Today, users will scroll. However, you shouldn't ignore the fold  and create endless pages for two reasons: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Long pages continue to be problematic because of users' limited attention span. </li>
    <li>The real estate above the fold is more valuable than the stuff below the fold for attracting and keeping users' attention. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>So, yes, you can put information below the fold rather than limit  yourself to bite-sized pages. <strong>In fact, if you have a long article, it's  better to present it as one scrolling canvas than to split it across  multiple pageviews. Scrolling beats paging because it's easier for  users to simply keep going down the page than it is to decide whether  or not to click through for a next page of a fragmented article.</strong> But  no, the fact that users scroll doesn't free you from prioritizing and  making sure that anything truly important remains above the fold.  Information foraging theory states that people decide whether to  continue along a path (including scrolling path down a page) based on  the current content's information scent. In other words, users will  scroll below the fold only if the information above it makes them  believe the reset of the page will be valuable. </p>

For a  continuous and lengthy content, like an article or a tutorial,  scrolling provides even better usability than slicing up the text to  several pages.</blockquote> </li>
