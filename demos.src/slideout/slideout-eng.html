<h2 id="cn_ed2">Effective date</h2>

<p>This standard comes into effect on January 1, 2007, and
replaces the following Treasury Board <em>Common Look and
Feel Standards and Guidelines for Internet</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard 1.1 - <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Checkpoints;</li>
<li>Standard 1.2 - Document Technologies;</li>
<li>Standard 1.3 - Alternate Formats;</li>
<li>Standard 1.4 - Text Equivalents;</li>

<li>Standard 6.8 - Validation;</li>
<li>Guideline 1.1 - HTML 4.0; and</li>
<li>Guideline 6.1 - Cascading Style Sheets</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cn_app2">Application</h2>

<p>This standard applies to institutions listed in Schedules I,
I.1 and II of the <em>Financial Administration
Act</em>.</p>

<h3><em>Related policies</em></h3>

<p>The institutions in question must also apply the following
policy instruments:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Common Look
and Feel Standards for the Internet, Part 1: Standard on Domain
Names;</em></li>

<li><em>Common Look
and Feel Standards for the Internet, Part 3: Standard on Common
Web Page Formats</em>; and</li>

<li><em>Common Look and Feel
Standards for the Internet, Part 4: Standard on
Email.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Institutions must also respect the official languages obligations set out in the <em>
Directive on the Use of Official Languages on Web Sites.
</em></p>

<h2 id="cn_cont2">Context</h2>
<p>Canadians have the right to obtain information and services
from Government of Canada Web sites regardless of the
technologies they use. The key to effective implementation of
universal accessibility lies in designing sites to serve the
widest possible audience and the broadest possible range of
hardware and software platforms, from adaptive technologies to
emerging technologies.</p>

<p>For many Canadians, accessing Web content is more complicated
than clicking a mouse and typing on a keyboard. Some Canadians
rely on adaptive technologies such as text readers, audio players
and voice-activated devices to overcome the barriers presented by
standard Internet technologies. Others may be limited by their
own technology.</p>

<p>The World Wide Web Consortium's Web Accessibility
Initiative (WAI) has developed universal accessibility
guidelines. Along with these <abbr title="Web Accessibility Initiative">WAI</abbr> guidelines and, in keeping with
the client-centred approach of Common Look and Feel, this
standard is directed toward ensuring equitable access to all
content on Government of Canada Web sites.</p>

<p>This standard clearly allows an institution to provide
information in multiple formats.</p>

<h2 id="cn_acc2">Accountability</h2>

<p>Deputy heads are accountable for
implementing this standard in their institutions.</p>

<h2 id="cn_req2">Requirements</h2>

<h3 id="cn_1_cww"><em>1. Compliance with World Wide Web Consortium Priority 1 and
Priority 2 checkpoints</em></h3>
<p>The institution respects the universal accessibility
guidelines developed by the World Wide Web Consortium's Web
Accessibility Initiative by ensuring compliance of its Web sites
with the Priority 1 and Priority 2 checkpoints of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (WCAG), with the following exception:</p>

<ul>
<li><abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> checkpoint 3.4 is superseded
by requirement 2 of the <em>Common Look and Feel Standards for
the Internet, Part 3: Standard on Common Web Page
Formats</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of the <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr>'s fourteen guidelines is accompanied by
one or more actions that a page author must perform to meet the
requirements of the guidelines. These actions are called
"checkpoints".</p>

<p>Institutions must consult the <em>
Directive on the Use of Official Languages on Web Sites</em> for
direction regarding the application of official languages
requirements to text equivalents and other non-textual
elements.</p>

<h3 id="cn_2_bt"><em>2. Baseline technologies</em></h3>
<p>To ensure content will be available to site visitors
regardless of the technical configuration of their system or
device, the institution must establish XHTML 1.0 Strict and
Cascading Style Sheets 1.0 as the baseline technologies for Web
page markup, layout and design.</p>

<h3 id="cn_3_aaf"><em>3.  Accessible alternate format of documents on Websites</em></h3>
<p>The institution uses standard methods to ensure accessibility of its products by employing languages described by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Recommendations. However, simply using these languages for markup or application design does not mean that products will be naturally accessible.</p>
<p>Where best efforts cannot make the content or application accessible - that is, where a document cannot be represented in XHTML&#160;1.0 Strict or a language described by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Recommendations - the institution must:</p>

<ul>
	<li>include an Accessibility Notice on the same page, immediately preceding the inaccessible element(s), that informs site visitors how to obtain accessible versions including print, Braille, and audio; and</li>
	<li>include an Accessibility Notice on the &#34;Help&#34; page(s) of the Web site.</li>
</ul>

<p>Providing accessible versions other than accessible XHTML is a &#34;last resort&#34; measure. It is not intended to be a convenient method of avoiding the often-minimal effort necessary to make Web pages or Web applications accessible.</p>

<h3 id="cn_4_oii"><em>4. Offering information in multiple formats</em></h3>
<p>The institution respects universal accessibility guidelines by
ensuring that Web pages offering information in multiple formats
include a text indication of the format, file type and size with
each non-XHTML format link. For each format that requires
specialized software, a hyperlink must be provided to a site
where the appropriate viewer or plug-in
application can be obtained. If an accessible version of a
plug-in is also known to be available, then a note and a link to
that product should also be included.</p>

<p>Neither this standard nor the World Wide Web Consortium's Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines suggest that a content provider
cannot provide information in multiple formats. What they do
require is that the first format encountered by a visitor is the
most accessible version.</p>

<p>Sample treatments of documents in
multiple formats and of multimedia files in multiple formats
are provided in the <abbr title="Common Look and Feel">CLF</abbr> Toolbox.</p>

<h3 id="cn_5_con"><em>5.  Contrast</em></h3>
<p>The institution must ensure that there is sufficient contrast
between textual elements and background colours or images when
the page is viewed by someone having colour deficits or when
viewed on a black and white screen.</p>
